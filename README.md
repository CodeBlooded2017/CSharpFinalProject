Code Louisville C# Final Project

Blues BBQ
This website was created for two purposes.  1) To meet final project standards set forth by the Code Louisville C#/.Net development education program.    

***Getting Started***
My most recent commit was to the BluesBBQ folder and should include all files needed for operation, but reference the other two files (.gitgnore and BluesBBQ.sln) as needed. 
Once loaded, select “Menu” from the navigation bar to see the project completion.  Under the “Menu” tab, you will be able to use the CRUD functions.
The site is responsive thanks to Bootstrap.
